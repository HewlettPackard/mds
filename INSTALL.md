# INSTALL instructions for Managed Data Structures (MDS)

Author: Susan Spence (susan.spence@hpe.com)

## Prerequisites

64-bit, Linux, C++ 14, JDK1.8, pthreads

- g++ 4.9.2, or g++ 5.4.0 or later   
  Note that MDS is known **not** to work with gcc 5.0, because of bugs in that version related to compilation of templates, which we use extensively.

- Java JDK 1.8   
  Note that you must use a Java JDK, not a more minimal Java installation.  This is needed for use of the JNI code.

- Managed Data Structures (MDS)

- Multi Process Garbage Collector (MPGC)

## Installations tested

* Linux: Debian Jessie (8.6), Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04.1 LTS) on x86_64 architecture, [https://github.com/FabricAttachedMemory/linux-l4fame](linux-l4fame)

* g++ 4.9.2 /usr/local/gcc-4.9.2/bin/gcc

    * Compiled from: source downloaded from mirror via https://gcc.gnu.org/

* jdk 1.8 /opt/jdk/jdk1.8.0_25/bin/java

    * Installed from: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

* MDS: https://github.com/HewlettPackard/mds

* MPGC: https://github.com/HewlettPackard/mpgc

MDS runs on 64-bit Linux; it has been tested on x86 and ARM architectures.

**NB**: MDS does not compile on Windows. We tried compiling it on Windows (we tried
really quite hard) but there are compilation problems with libraries we use. So
don't waste your time trying to compile on Windows; just compile on Linux!

**NB**: MDS won't run on a virtual machine, if the virtual machine doesn't support a shared mmap file.

## Build process

Set environment variable JDKHOME to point to the top-level directory of your JDK 1.8 installation.

Ensure the top-level MDS directory is called "mds".  (If you downloaded the zip file, it will be called mds-master and you will need to move it to mds instead.)

Assuming MDS and its dependency MPGC have been cloned to the same top-level directory, to compile sources for MDS:

    cd mds/java-api
    ant -f build-all.xml

The build will take about 30-40 minutes to complete on an average Linux server.

    
## Build details

We use ant at the top level and in our demo directories, with build files that were handcrafted by one of our developers.

The C++ implementation of MDS and MPGC is built using an Autobuild process which is documented in
    [java-api/build/BUILDING.md](java-api/build/BUILDING.md)

The build process:
- compiles the code common to both MDS and MPGC first, into libruts.a;
- then compiles the code for MPGC into libmpgc.a;
- then compiles the MDS core implementation and JNI code and incorporates it, libruts.a and libmpgc.a into libmds-jni.so;
- then compiles the MDS Java API and annotations processing code into two jar files mds-annotations-processor.jar and mds-java-api.jar.


The code common to both MDS and MPGC is compiled to libruts.a:
where "ruts" stands for "Really Useful ToolS".

The MDS library libmds-jni.so can be built either optimised or debug.
By default it is built optimised; to build debug instead: 
    cd mds/java-api
    ant -f build-all.xml -Dbuild=debug

To see if the build has completed successfully, 
check for the existence of the following files: 

- when built optimized: 

    mds/java-api/build/intel-opt/libs/libmds-jni.so
    mds-annotations-processor.jar
    mds-java-api.jar

- when built debug:
    mds/java-api/build/intel-debug/libmds-jni.so
    mds-annotations-processor.jar
    mds-java-api.jar

If you have a problem, and need to clean the build and start again: 
    cd mds/java-api
    ant -f build-all.xml clean


## Using the MDS library

To compile a Java application that uses MDS, the programmer uses the JAR files for the MDS Java API.

See the Usage section of [README.md](README.md) for a few simple code examples that illustrate basic use of MDS.

For more detailed information on the MDS API, see the documentation:
  https://github.com/HewlettPackard/mds/blob/master/doc/MDS%20Java%20API.pdf


## Demo using MDS

To see an example program using MDS, have a look at the MDS Inventory Demo in: [demo/inventory](demo/inventory).  
Follow the instructions in [demo/inventory/INSTALL.md](demo/inventory/INSTALL.md) to compile the demo sources and run the MDS Inventory demo.
